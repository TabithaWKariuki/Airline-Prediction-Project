# Airline-Delay-Prediction-Project
With the instantaneous development of todayâ€™s air transport industry, airline travel has in the recent past become a very popular mode of travel. There are so many benefits of traveling by air as compared to other forms of travel. Most important of these benefits being safety and speed. Flying has also become quite affordable in the past decade and it is the most preferred by people traveling both far and short distances. Despite these benefits there are still some disadvantages to flying, among them being delays in flights. Delay in flight is an inevitable phenomenon which has significant negative economic effects on airports, passengers and travel agencies. A flight delay is when an airline flight takes off and/or lands later than its scheduled time. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) considers a flight to be delayed when it is 15 minutes later than its scheduled time. A cancellation occurs when the airline does not operate the flight at all for a certain reason.

I shall be working as a data scientist. I have been tasked to analyse and predict wbuild a model that predicts whether a given flight will be delayed given the information in the scheduled departure.
## Research Problem
With this study, we aim at predicting if a flight will be delayed or not depending on the factors that we will analyze. Predicting flight delays will help improve airline operations and attain passenger satisfaction, which will result in a positive economic impact on passengers, airlines, airports and travel agencies.
In order to work on the above problem, you need to do the following:
* Define the question, the metric for success, the context, experimental design taken and the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question
* Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.
* Perform univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis recording your observations.
* Perform/Fit model and check their accuracy level.
* Challenge your solution by providing insights on how you can make improvements.
